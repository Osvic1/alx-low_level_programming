### Bit Manupulation in C
>
> 0. Function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int` where `b` is pointing to a string of `0` and `1` chars.   
> 1. Function that prints the binary representation of a number.  
> 2. Function that returns the value of a bit at a given `index`. where `index` is the index, starting from `0`.  
> 3. Function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given `index`.  
> 4. Sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given `index`.  
> 5. Function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. Not allowed to use the `%` or `/` operators.  
> 6. Fuction that checks the endianness and returns `0` if `big endian`, `1` if `little endian`.
